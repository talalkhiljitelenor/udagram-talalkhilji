# Setup Node Environment
You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:

# Initialize a new project: `npm i`
run the development server with `npm run dev`

# Access following url in postman

http://{{HOST}}/filteredimage?image_url=https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/04/23/22/00/tree-736885__340.jpg

Host consists of localhost path and port e.g localhost:3000

The project was deployed using the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI 
`eb init`, `eb create`, and `eb deploy` commands.
